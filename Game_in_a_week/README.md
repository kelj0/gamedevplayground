### Build a game in a week

This is a small project/test that I need to do when I catch some time.
After the game is done I need to learn how to scale it, introduce multiplayer and so on. 

There are a few rules to this challenge: 

Tools: 
- you can use only SFML
- use any audio, no need to create your sounds

That means you need to build an:
- simple 2d game engine to power up your game (we want to create sequels right?)
- simple 2d box like level designer (we dont want to hardcode levels right?)
- create the actual game
